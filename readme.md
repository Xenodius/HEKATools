## HEKA Tools
This package contains 
1. HEKA Preprocessing tools to convert HEKA Patchmaster data into compact Axon Binary Files (.ABF) compatible with ClampFit, an excellent software suite for data inspection and manual measurements.  Metadata is also read and conveniently arranged into Excel summaries.

2. Common Analysis contains tools to quickly read and plot routinely checked parameters such as capacitance, current-voltage profiles, rheobase, etc.
3. DRG Analysis contains tools to quickly classify physiologic parameters of dorsal root ganglia, and generate Excel summaries and figures of these data.
4. Go Analysis contains a tool to integrate raw positional data generated by Any-Maze into heat-map plots.

### HEKA Preprocessing
To use, 
1. Set path to a folder containing data exported from Patchmaster as numbered .asc text. 
2. Export parameters to this folder as 'parameters.*' text.
3. Run
